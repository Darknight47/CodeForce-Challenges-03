Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones. n times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile.
The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

You are given n operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.

Input
The first line contains one positive integer n — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The next line contains the string s, consisting of n symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes).
If Vasya took the stone on i-th operation, s(i) is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added, si is equal to "+" (without quotes).

Output
Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these n operations.

Input:
3
