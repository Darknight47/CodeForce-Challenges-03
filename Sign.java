AquaMoon has a string a consisting of only 0 and 1. She wants to add + and − between all pairs of
consecutive positions to make the absolute value of the resulting expression as small as possible. Can you help her?

Input
The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2000)  – the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of a.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of length n, consisting of only 0 and 1.

Output
For each test case, output a string of length n−1 consisting of − and + on a separate line.
If there is more than one assignment of signs that produces the smallest possible absolute value, any of them is accepted.
